Description of flaw 1:

Currently CSRF tokens are commented out, which means that POST requests are not checked wether they are from malicious attackers or from innocent users.

Fix to flaw 1:

Add {% csrf_token %} template tag into every form of html files and remove @csrf_exempt decorator from the views.py file.
